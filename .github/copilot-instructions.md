# Copilot Instructions

You are working in a quantitative research repository with Jupyter notebooks. Follow these rules:

- Prefer `rg` for search.
- Make minimal edits and avoid unrelated formatting changes.
- Keep markdown professional and academic; focus on statistical rigor.
- Use ?candidate model?, ?in-sample evaluation?, and ?sampling variability? when appropriate.
- Document assumptions (IID, autocorrelation, stationarity) and limitations.
- Keep metrics tied to sampling frequency; mention annualization only when necessary.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Use Ruff for Python linting when requested; avoid auto-fix unless explicitly asked.
