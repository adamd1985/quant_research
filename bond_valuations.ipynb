Another risk we have to avoid is recall risk, some bonds can be racalled and refinanced - this happens when the interest rates go down and the bond issuer pays up the face value and reissues the bonds at lower coupon rates, when this happens the original bond holders will have to reinvest in a less yielding instrument."
