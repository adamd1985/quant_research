This means that the price decreases as the interest rates increase, because higher yielding instruments will be issued.\n\nConvexity is the bond's price sensitivity to it's yield. Yields go up as price goes down, if the interest rates are now higher than the bond's coupon, sellers need to up the yield by decreasing the bond's price.\n\nThese concepts serve to insulate one's portfolio from interest rates risk. In our case, we are only shopping for bonds we would like to hold to maturity, we'll accept the rates risk. \n\nThere is one risk we won't accept though, that is default risk - we said treasuries are risk free, but other bonds are not, especially ones issued by the private sector. When shopping for bonds, select investment grade ratings from Moody's or S&P (anything in the As ratings, with AAA being the highest). \n\nBonds with high risk of default have high yields to offset this, though they are not called 'junk bonds' for nothing (read about Argentina's sovereign bonds in 2001). Another risk we have to avoid is recall risk, some bonds can be racalled and refinanced - this happens when the interest rates go down and the bond issuer pays up the face value and reissues the bonds at lower coupon rates, when this happens the original bond holders will have to reinvest in a less yielding instrument.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Ranking our Fixed Income Dataset\n\nWe load our dataset which is comprised of treasuries, municipals (Munies), corporate and certificates of deposits (CDs).
